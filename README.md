# HN: Huge Numbers and maybe a scripting language at some point
## Did you ever dream of calculating with numbers so long you can't even imagine? Well now you can as long as you have enough RAM installed. Hugenumbers will work for you. The question is whether you would want to. Please read the description below

1. This is a simple project not dedicated to be efficient
2. The numbers are stored in linked lists. Each element is a digit. This is not very efficient.
3. Those linked list containing numbers are chained together usingg another linked list. This is created by the lexer aswell as the preprocessor, we will not really distinguish betweeen those things since there is no real difference between them in this case.
4. The operation linked list will then be interpreted. I don't know how yet
5. Maybe I will add support for direct compilation to ASM, but this can wait
6. This is a VERY simple language. I justed wanted to figure out a way how compilers/interpreters work by coming up with my own solution
7. The code is longer than it should be
8. You are very likely to be a faggot/cuck/moron
9. If you are no faggot/cuck/moron you are welcome to add a pull request or open an issue
